Implementing Order Processing, Notifications, and Reporting services involves several steps. Below is a basic outline for each:

### Order Processing

1. **Create New Orders**: Define a service method to create a new order. This method should validate the order data and insert it into the OrdersTable.

2. **Update Order Status**: Define a service method to update the status of an existing order. This method should take the order ID and the new status as parameters and update the corresponding record in the OrdersTable.

3. **Calculate Order Totals**: Define a service method to calculate the total price of an order. This method should take the order ID as a parameter, fetch the order details from the database, calculate the total based on the price of each menu item, and update the total price in the OrdersTable.

### Notifications

1. **Send Order Updates**: Define a service method to send notifications to users about order updates. This method should take the user ID and the order details as parameters, generate a notification message, and send it to the user via their preferred communication channel (e.g., email, SMS).

2. **Send Promotions**: Define a service method to send promotional notifications to users. This method should take the user ID and the promotion details as parameters, generate a promotional message, and send it to the user via their preferred communication channel.

### Reporting

1. **Generate Sales Reports**: Define a service method to generate sales reports. This method should query the OrdersTable for orders within a specified time period, calculate the total sales for each restaurant, and generate a report with the sales data.

2. **Generate User Activity Reports**: Define a service method to generate user activity reports. This method should query the OrdersTable for orders placed by each user, calculate the total number of orders and the total amount spent by each user, and generate a report with the user activity data.

Here's a basic implementation for each service:

```typescript
// Order Processing
export class OrderService {
    // Create New Order
    async createOrder(orderData: Partial<TIOrdersTable>): Promise<TSOrdersTable> {
        const newOrder = await db.insert(OrdersTable).values(orderData).execute();
        return newOrder;
    }

    // Update Order Status
    async updateOrderStatus(orderId: number, status: string): Promise<void> {
        await db.update(OrdersTable).set({ order_status: status }).where(eq(OrdersTable.id, orderId)).execute();
    }

    // Calculate Order Total
    async calculateOrderTotal(orderId: number): Promise<number> {
        const orderItems = await db.query(OrderMenuItemTable).select().where(eq(OrderMenuItemTable.orderId, orderId)).execute();
        const total = orderItems.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.price, 0);
        return total;
    }
}

// Notifications
export class NotificationService {
    // Send Order Update Notification
    async sendOrderUpdateNotification(userId: number, orderId: number, message: string): Promise<void> {
        // Implementation to send notification to user
    }

    // Send Promotion Notification
    async sendPromotionNotification(userId: number, promotion: string): Promise<void> {
        // Implementation to send promotion notification to user
    }
}

// Reporting
export class ReportingService {
    // Generate Sales Report
    async generateSalesReport(startDate: Date, endDate: Date): Promise<any> {
        // Implementation to generate sales report
    }

    // Generate User Activity Report
    async generateUserActivityReport(): Promise<any> {
        // Implementation to generate user activity report
    }
}
```

These are basic implementations, and you may need to customize them based on your specific requirements and the features provided by your database and notification service.
